		- EG: Consider an example of a restaurant entrepreneur, partnering with a well known chef to develop a new restaurant in a bustling part of the cityâ€™s central shopping district. The well known chef has several restaurants across the city. Banking on their reputation, the restaurant entrepreneur and chef followed gut instinct and created another uniquely themed restaurant. However, fundraising efforts fell short to fund the opening of the restaurant after months of planning and preparation. The property will go back on the market to be sold at a loss. Had the entrepreneur done more research, they would've found data showing prospective customers in this new restaurant location were very different from the chef's other restaurants.
