Doing any thing new just dont jump and break your head instead relax and take help from people who have done or research about it or see any references to ace faster. 

what happened is i tried to install a docker image in casa os mannually but i forgot and saw some blog post was not intrested to see any video because it will consume more time so eventually i saw video tooo but that file system and how to name the image they did not mention, suddenly I saw another casaos file of pi hole for refrence then i got i idea and finally we did it so always take time see resources and refrtences before going and blindly exuting anything bye.... AND BY THE WAY I AM SO THOUGHT FULL TODAY BECAUSE I WOKE UP EARLY :)
